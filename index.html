		<article class="article">

			<p>This analysis looks into how many of the top 50 universities, as ranked by <a href="http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/data">US News & World Report</a>, have had female leaders (presidents, chancellors, etc).</p>

			<p><span class="emphasis">Less than half</span> of the country's top universities and colleges have had women leading them, our analysis shows.</p>			

			<section class="text">
				<div class="text">
					<p><span class="emphasis">University of Wisconsin-Madison</span>, <span class="emphasis">University of Pennsylvania</span>, and <span class="emphasis">Brown University</span> have each had three female presidents.</p>

					<p><span class="emphasis">Yale University</span> was the first university in the list to have a female president - <strong>Hanna Holborn Gray</strong> - though she was the acting president for a year.</p>

					<p>Gray then went on to become a full-time president at the <span class="emphasis">University of Chicago</span>.</p>

					<!-- <ul> These universities currently have a female president:

				<h3>How it was done:</h3>
				<p>A list of all the university presidents was compiled from the university websites. These include interim presidents and acting presidents. There were cases in which interim presidents were not mentioned on the university website but was seen elsewhere (Wikipedia). These names were not included (in any case, they were mostly men).</p>

				<p>Cleaning was done in Python and the data was analyzed for gender by comparing the names with the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">baby names database</a> released by the Social Security administration.</p>

				<p> Some older names didn't turn up on the list, so their gender was manually entered.</p>

				<p>Visualization was done with d3.js</p>
