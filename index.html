				<h3>How it was done:</h3>
				<p>A list of all the university presidents was compiled from the university websites. These include interim presidents and acting presidents. There were cases in which interim presidents were not mentioned on the university website but was seen elsewhere (Wikipedia). These names were not included (in any case, they were mostly men).</p>

				<p>Cleaning was done in Python and the data was analyzed for gender by comparing the names with the <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">baby names database</a> released by the Social Security administration.</p>

				<p> Some older names didn't turn up on the list, so their gender was manually entered.</p>

				<p>Visualization was done with d3.js</p>
